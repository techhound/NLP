# NLP
This tutorial shows how to implement the workflow of Natural Language Processing without using any NLP libraries. The purpose of this is to help newcomers to the field of NLP
to become familiar with the steps that would be required for a small NLP project. Although no NLP libraries were used, preprocessing for NLP is usually similar from one
project to the next.
